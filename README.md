Code in Place 2021 Lessons, CS106A: Programming Methodologies, Stanford University, section 811, leader Chao Li

It was a free course with 2 stages to get to the course. 
I was lucky to get the free place. 

5 weeks in groups of 5 people, with video lessons and collabotations each friday.
My mentor (leader of our group) was from Silicon Valley, CA.
It was great 5 weeks.
Some of my projects in Python performed on this course I still have to add to this repositiry!!!
